      <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
      <p>Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.

              Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. 
              
              WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.
              
              Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>Besides anthropogenic factors, there are other factors which are considered natural – such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires. Though these are rather sporadic, they can pump large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases can block out the sunlight, plunging the world into an ice age; or trap the heat from the sun, causing global warming. Following are some of the major causes of air pollution – anthropogenic and natural factors are included:

              Burning of fossil fuels:
              The combustion of fossil fuels pumps out a lot of greenhouse gases. Vehicles are one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions. Moreover, most industries also rely on fossil fuels to power their machinery.
              
              Agricultural activities
              Ammonia is one of the most common by-products of agricultural activities. It is also extremely toxic if inhaled.
              
              Mining operations
              Mining operations are one of the major culprits of air pollution. Toxic substances are released during the operations that may negatively affect the health of the workers and the people that live nearby.
              
              Indoor Air pollution
              Air pollution can also happen indoors – for instance; radon gas is colourless and odourless. It also has the tendency to accumulate inside closed spaces, such as the basements of buildings. This gas is also considered to be a carcinogen; hence it may cause cancer.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="effects">
            <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate.

              Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic respiratory diseases.  
              
              Additionally, around 2.4 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal.
              
              The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths annually.
              
              Sources of air pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution.</p>

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>1. Using public transports<br>
              Using public transport is a sure short way of contributing to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy, even carpools contribute to it. In addition to less release of fuels and gas, using a public transport can also help in saving money. Lesser vehicles on roads will contribute to lesser emissions. Using public transport will help in:
              
              Reducing the overall emissions
              Number of vehicles reduced on the roads
              Lesser traffic congestion episodes
              It is pocket friendly alternative.</p>
              <p>2. Turn off the lights when not in use<br>
                The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.
                
                reduce air pollution
                
               <p>3.Recycle and Reuse</p<br>
                The concept of recycle and reuse is not just conserve resources and use them judicially but also is helpful for air pollution as it helps in reducing pollution emissions. The recycled products also take less power to make other products.
                
                </p>
                <p>4. No to plastic bags
                  The use of plastic products could be very harmful to the environment as they take a very long time to decompose, due to their material made up of oil. The use of paper bags instead is a better alternative as they decompose easily and are recyclable.
                  
                  5. Reduction of forest fires and smoking
                  The collecting of garbage and getting it on fire in dry seasons or dry leaves catching fires is a huge factor for causing air pollution, moreover smoking also causes air pollution and causes the air quality to worsen along with obviously damaging one’s health.
                  
                  6. Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner
                  The usage of AC’s takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment. AC’s also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.</p>
